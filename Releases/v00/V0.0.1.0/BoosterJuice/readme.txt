- pre-release setup of Booster Juice mod
this mod features the good "fertilizer" produced in the "chemist". The fertilizer can then be distributed to "fertilizer distribution" stations (dumps) which than have a range effect on the growing trees around them. 

Each hour the fertilizer distrubation station is manned and has enough fertilizer, the fertilizer is pumped into the ground and taken up by surrounding growing trees. With this the trees get a boost in growth. Each hour, the effect becomes smaller, until a new day starts and the cycle begins a new. 

The maxmimum boost (24h worker available, e.g. bots) is 100% growth, meaning a tree grows in half the time it would normally need.
